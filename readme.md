# PSS: A simple python stresser to stress by layer 4.

## Overview

- this project is a simple python stresser which can be used for tcp/udp protocol.

- we will add features and complete this readme.md file.


### Key Features 🚀

- Lightweight - this project is focused on being clean code, which means our stresser is going to work as best as it can.
- Console Arguments - you can do whatever based on command line.
- easy to use configuration - (soon)
- NOTE: python isn't a good language for stress testing, since we can't get high p/s. which means we will rewrite this project, into other programming language, for sure.

## Getting Started 🚧
